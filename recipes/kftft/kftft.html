      <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
      <h3>KICHA</h3>
      <uL>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>KICHA FITFIT</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon berbere</li>
        <li>1 batch Kicha (recipe above), torn into bite-size pieces (about 6 cups)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
      <h3>KICHA</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the whole wheat and all-purpose flours and salt in a large bowl and whisk well to combine </li>
        <li>Using your hands, mix in the water</li>
        <li>The batter will be like a very thick pancake batter.</li>
        <li>Line a plate with paper towels and set aside</li>
        <li>Set a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of the oil, tilting the pan so the oil lightly greases the bottom of the pan</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, add half the dough to the skillet and use wet fingertips to gently and carefully press the dough into a wide circle that covers the surface of the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet and cook until the top of the dough is glossy and the underside is golden brown, about 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Carefully flip the bread over, cover, and cook until the second side is browned, another 2 to 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Transfer the flatbread to the prepared plate, adding the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan, and repeat the process with the remaining dough</li>
        <li>Serve immediately while the breads are warm, or let cool to room temperature to use for Kicha Fit Fit.</li>
        <li>Leftover breads can be stored in a plastic bag at room temperature for a day and rewarmed in a skillet over low heat.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>KICHA FITFIT</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the butter in a large nonstick skillet set over medium heat</li>
        <li> Once the butter melts, add the berbere and cook, stirring, until the spices sizzle and smell fragrant, about 30 seconds</li>
        <li>Add the kicha pieces and sprinkle with the salt</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring, until all the pieces of kicha are coated with the spiced butter and warmed through, about 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to a serving platter or individual bowls, top with the yogurt, and serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
