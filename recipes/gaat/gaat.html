      <h1>GA'AT/PORIDGE</h1>
      <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups of wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon berbere (a hot spice used in <strong>Eritrea & Ethiopia</strong>)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon melted butter</li>
        <li>1 ltr water</li>
        <li>¼ cup of oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>to make Ga’at recipe
          , take a dry pan. Add the wheat flour to it and gradually dry roast for 2-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>take another large pan to boil water nicely on medium-hot heat.
            Remove 250 ml simmering water and placed it aside.</li>
        <li>take a large pan and mix the toasted wheat flour and the boiling water slowly, and carefully.</li>
        <li>keep the heat down after adding a significant amount of toasted flour.
           The mixture starts to get deeply stout which makes it hard to mix.</li>
        <li>When the stew gets very hard that means there will not be any chunks. </li>
        <li>After that, add a little cold water and wheat flour to a bowl and mix them well.</li>
        <li>add the wheat paste to the pan. Keep spinning and cuisine for up to 15 minutes. Then you can add salt to it.</li>
        <li>Next, add oil to a helping bowl.</li>
        <li>Move the bowl from side to side to form a nice ball.</li>
        <li>After that, make a wall using the back of your spoon at the center of the Ga'at ball.</li>
        <li>Lastly, add the melted butter to the wall. While the Ga'at is still hot,
          add the butter together with the berbere and mix them on the wall, and serve the Ga'at immediately.</li>
        <li>You can also add yogurt when eating if preferred </li>
      </ol>
